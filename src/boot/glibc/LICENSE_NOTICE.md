This folder contains GPLv2 sources, which match the ROM 1:1 identically. However, this is untenable as it would position this commercial software to be put into GPL per the license requirements. This notice is a short term one notating the license conflict; currently, we are reaching out to the FSF (Free Software Foundation) to see what actions can be taken to remedy the untentable situation.

We thank you for your patience while we are attempting to resolve the license conflict.
