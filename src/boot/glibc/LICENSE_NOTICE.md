This folder contains GPLv2 sources, sourced from https://github.com/omuses/hqp/tree/ae4d4d6618d4530f4c863cce90ff1934029a3da0/malloc . The library provided can build both gmalloc and libmalloc.a, however this appears to be libmalloc.a. Only the files necessary for building and matching are provided here. The original Makefile system is not used as this is not running on a native IRIX system and thus wont use the correct compiler.
